# IT214 - Version jump to make sure samples don't get screwed up by the
#         prerelease (IT213) loader. This is the FINAL public release. Apart
#         from bugfixes/new soundcard drivers, don't expect to see anything in
#         the future...
# 
#   - Samples are now compressed on the fly when saved and loaded from disk.
#     Note that this is NOT the same as using MMCMP.

# IT214 Patch 4 - This release has been made entirely for the VSOUND drivers,
#                 which will allow you to setup IT to run under Windows '95/'98
#                 with *ANY* soundcard. Check ITVSOUND.TXT for more information.

# Wikipedia: The last version, v2.14 Patch #5, was released April 8, 1999.

# Contributors Additions
#  - IT215 file format saving. Note that this is an alternative compression
#      format and is often better, but not always. Public releases of IT214
#      Patch 1 and later can read IT215 compressed files. There is also a
#      version of MikIT that can read IT215 compression.
