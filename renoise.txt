# Some info from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renoise

# Renoise was originally written from the code of another tracker called
# NoiseTrekker, made by Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius (Arguru). The then
# unnamed Renoise project was initiated by Eduard Mueller (Taktik) and
# Zvonko Tesic (Phazze) during December 2000. The development team
# planned to take tracking software into a new standard of quality,
# enabling tracking scene composers to make audio of the same quality as
# other existing professional packages, while still keeping the proven
# layout that originated with Soundtracker in 1987. By early 2002 stable
# versions (such as 1.27) were available. Over the years the development
# team has grown to distribute the tasks of testing, administrative,
# support and web duties among several people.
