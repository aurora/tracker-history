# Some info from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renoise

# Renoise was originally written from the code of another tracker called
# NoiseTrekker, made by Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius (Arguru). The then
# unnamed Renoise project was initiated by Eduard Mueller (Taktik) and
# Zvonko Tesic (Phazze) during December 2000. By early 2002 stable
# versions (such as 1.27) were available.
