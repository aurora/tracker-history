# Mentions SoundFX v1.7 and v1.945

# From http://aminet.net/package/mus/play/EP_SoundFX
# "This player uses the replay routine ripped from the SoundFX 1.8 editor
#  and perhaps plays all SoundFX (15 samples) songs correctly. SoundFX 1.8
#  has one extra command that the SoundFX 1.3 editor did not have.

# From readme:
# AdeptTracker is far from finished and should not be considered as a final
# product. The main reason I have decided to release this version is for
# archiving purposes only. AdeptTracker is as I se it rather unique since it's
# the only system GUI application that tries to "copy" the ProTracker
# userinterface (inspired by ProTracker V2.3a).
