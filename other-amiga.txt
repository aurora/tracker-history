# From readme:
# AdeptTracker is far from finished and should not be considered as a final
# product. The main reason I have decided to release this version is for
# archiving purposes only. AdeptTracker is as I se it rather unique since it's
# the only system GUI application that tries to "copy" the ProTracker
# userinterface (inspired by ProTracker V2.3a).
