# Bugs corrected in V1.0 Release B:
# ---------------------------------
#  - PatternLoop (It always jumped to the start of the pattern, not the loop)
#  - Zap had put FineTune AND Glissando-Control in the same command! (E3)
#  - Fade Up / Down caused shit and even a few gurus!
#  - Delete Pos inserted pattern 77 (!) at position 127 in the song, causing
#    it to be longer than 80k!
#  - Filter All Samples was slow as hell because it tried to filter non-
#    existant samples.
#  - If you selected sample 0 from the keypad, it always played the last
#    sample played as sample 0!
#  - A590 harddisk owners couldn't use the keyboard because of the way Mahoney
#    & Kaktus set up the keyboard interrupt (we used their NT1.1 routine).
#  - Entering the help screen when in the midi screen fucked up the display.
#  - Escaping from Mix exited from the whole edit op.!
#  - CutBeg no longer fucks up the Sample length and Pos.
#  - The help file was FULL of bugs / misspellings.

# -------------------------------------------
# 
# - Load gadget no longer hangs the program when trying to load a file that
#   doesn't exist.
# - Better filehandling with error messages.
# - Repeat and replen check installed (Rel. A hanged when replen accidentally
#   got the value zero).
# - Repeat and replen were swapped when loading an IFF sample.
# - Only RepLen values in IFF samples were added in the preset-editor.
# - Tune memory wasn't always updated when editing samples.
# - Swap Buffer debugged.
# - The arpeggio sounded weird because the pitch wasn't set back at the
#   right time.
# - Shift speeds up the scrolling in the PLST and preset-editor.

		Fix Sample function with OS2.0

		No crash when loading non-module
		MIDI In works as it should!!!

# "This is the same as the old protracker 1.2b or so
#  but with the added benefit of doing real 8 channel
#  modules. What you do is hook up two amigas via a null
#  cable (serial to serial)  and then when you play/record
#  on one amiga it instantly (with maximum 20ms delay apart)
#  does the same on the other one, so just make two modules
#  which play well together and pressplay on either ONE!"
