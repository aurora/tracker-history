Tracker History Graphing
------------------------

Tracker dependencies are described in the source files named after tracker
families such as Protracker, Noisetracker or Startrekker. Each tracker is
a node in the graph, and the edges show the relationship between tracker
releases.

You can obtain the latest version of the tracker history files at
http://helllabs.org/tracker-history/. A git repository is also available,
you can get it with

	git clone http://helllabs.org/git/tracker-history.git

If you add new nodes or fix errors in the existing nodes, please send the
patches or new files to cmatsuoka@gmail.com.

Source files are converted to Graphviz dotfiles using a modified version of
Warren Toomey's 'todot' script for the Unix History Graphing Project at
http://minnie.tuhs.org/Unix_History/. Graphviz is a graph visualization
software package available at http://www.graphviz.org/.

Source files and resulting dotfiles are released to the public domain and
may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used or modified by
anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial. The todot script is
Copyrighted by Warren Toomey and modified by Claudio Matsuoka, and subject
to license restrictions from the original Unix History Graphing Project
todot script.


Source file format:

<nickname>:
	Name: <name and version>
	Author: <name of author>
	Date: <YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM | YYYY>
	Comment: <optional text>
	Based on <nickname> [ <weight> ] [ <enhancements> ]
	Influenced by <nickname> [ <weight> ] [ <influences> ]

Please indicate the source of information for the entries, especially
release dates or influences.

'Based on' indicates that the current release is based on the codebase
of the listed release. 'Influenced by', on the other hand, implies that
there is no significant code shared between the two releases (example:
UNIS669 is influenced by, but not based on, Composer 669). Enhancements
from the previous release can be listed after the release nickname or
optional node weight, enclosed in [ ].

'Influenced by' should be used when there is explicit influence mentioned
in the tracker documentation (or by the tracker author), or when there is
an obvious influence of a tracker on another (example: MED was influenced
by Soundtracker VI as mentioned in the docs, or the visible influence of
Scream Tracker 3 on the design of the Impulse Tracker interface). Influences
can be listed after the release nickname or optional node weight, enclosed
in [ ].
