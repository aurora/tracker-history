# Some info from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skale_Tracker

# Skale Tracker is a tracker software created and coded by baktery with
# graphics-support from Awesome. It was originally released in early alpha
# stage as Fast Tracker 3, as the entire environment was designed to be as
# similar to Fast Tracker 2 as possible, but had to change its name for
# legal reasons. The design and general Fast Tracker-resemblance stayed
# the same, though. It is available for both Microsoft Windows and Linux.
# Skale features ASIO, WAV-renderer, support for SF2 and AKAI-instruments,
# MIDI I/O, VST instrument support and more.
