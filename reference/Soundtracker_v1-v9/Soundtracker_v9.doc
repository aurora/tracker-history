--------------------------

                Enhanced portamento.
                Volume changing during play.
                Filter control during play! (some A500+A2000)
                Speed control during play.
                New voice control.
                Improved DIR function.
                Standart USA keymap.
                New playroutine from Obarski (Improved by Unknown of D.O.C)
                Plastic cursor (hehe)
                New scrolltexts (hoehoe)
                Better colors (thanx to J.C.)
Patterns.
---------
Any piece of music written with SoundTracker IX is build up from patterns.
SoundTracker holds a table with information about the sequence in which
these parts must be played. With 'Position' you determine your position
in the table. With 'Pattern' you define what pattern to play at that
position. 'Length' defines the total size of the table.

The Keys.
---------
The original (V1.8) version of the SoundTracker had a German keymap.
Version IX supports a standard USA keymap and this ensures compatibility
with ALL Amigas.
The keys on your Amiga have been grouped to represent the layout of a
two-octave piano-keyboard. You can "shift" the keyboard one octave up or
down with the aid of the F1 and F2 keys, thus incrementing the range of
the keyboard to three octaves.

While editing: Cursor-keys move cursor.
-------------  F6  - Set cursor to first line of pattern.
               F7  - Set cursor to 16th line of pattern.
               F8  - Set cursor to 32th line of pattern.
               F9  - Set cursor to 48th line of pattern.
               F10 - Set cursor to last line of pattern.
               DEL - Delete note under cursor.
       shift + F3  - Cut selected voice of actual pattern.
       shift + F4  - Copy selected voice of actual pattern into copy-buffer.
       shift + F5  - Copy copy-buffer to selected voice of actual pattern.
      
Special keys:
------------
       shift + V   - MESSAGES and GREETINX from D.O.C
       shift + D   - DIRECTORY (left mouse button for next entry -
                                right to abort.)
The following keys are on your numeral pad at the right side of your
keyboard.

  !!   --->      7   - Sets the volume from voice 1 to zero.
  !!   --->      4   - Sets the volume from voice 2 to zero.
  !!   --->      1   - Sets the volume from voice 3 to zero.
  !!   --->      0   - Sets the volume from voice 4 to zero.

Instruments.
------------
You can use up to fifteen different instruments in one music-piece.
All instruments are listed in the preset-list. The volume is allways
64 but you can change it to each value between 0 and 64.
To change the other values of each instrument you have to load the
preset-editor. With that tool you can change the whole preset-list.

Notes.
------
               C#1   3 C 2 3
               /    /  |  \|
              /    /   |   Arpeggio,portamento,volume,speed and filter info.
             /    /  Command
            /   Inst#
         Note to
         be played.

Note    : This is simply the note that must be played by that particular
----      instrument.

Inst#   : This is the number of the instrument that must be used to play
-----     the note. When the instrument number is zero, the last selected
          instrument will be used.

Command : This number tells SoundTracker what special functions must be
-------   preformed while playing the note.

These functions are as follows :

     0 - Normal play or arpeggio.
     1 - Portamento up.
     2 - Portamento down.
     C - Set volume.
     E - Set filter on/off!
     F - Set speed.

Info    : This byte contains the additional information for the commands.
----     
Arpeggio : Arpeggio is used for simulating accords. It does this by
--------   rapidly changing the notes while playing an instrument.
           Arpeggios are selected whenever the info byte has a non-zero
           value and no other commands are selected.
           When arpeggios are used, SoundTracker looks five times during
           the play of one note, at the information contained in the info
           byte. Each nibble (4 bits) in this byte defines
           how many notes SoundTracker must add to the the note currently
           playing. In each of the five passes SoundTracker does the
           following with the information contained in the info byte :
       
           1 - Add the first nibble to the current note.
           2 - Add the second nibble to the current note.
           3 - Play the current note.
           4 - Add the first nibble to the current note.
           5 - Add the second nibble to the current note.

Portamento : Portamento is used for 'sliding' of the instrument.
----------   If portamento is in use, the information contained in
             the info byte will be added to (or subtracted from) the period
             of the note playing in each of the five passes.

   Example : D#2 3208  Slides down 8
             --- 0208  Slides down 8
             --- 0108  Slides up 8
             --- 0210  Slides down 10
             etc.

Volume : One of the enhancements that the V9.0 version provides is the
------   ability to change the volume at any time during play.
         When command 12 ($C) is selected, the volume is set to the value
         contained in the info byte. The volume will remain at this level
         until a next SAMPLE is played. At this time, the volume is
         reset to the default volume level of that sample.

Example: C#1 1C22 - Set volume to $22 and use instrument # 1 to
                    play the C#1 note.
         D-2 0000 - Use instrument # 1 to play the D-2 note.
                    (Volume level remains at $22)
         B-1 1000 - Use instrument # 1 to play the B-1 note and
                    set volume to default value for that
                    instrument.

Filter:  This Soundtracker version allows you to turn the lo-pass filter
------   on/off.

Example: G#2 1E01 - Turns the filter and the power-led off !
         --- 0000
         E-1 1E00 - Turns the filter and the power-led on !

Warning to all Amiga 1000 owners :
Don't make jokes with the power-led because some A500 and A2000 owners will
not be happy when they hear your song. The music on the A500 sounds like 
garbage with the LED flicking on and off (RASTA CATCHA)

Speed:   This function allows changing the speed during play.
------   You can only enter a speed between 01 and 0F.
         Setting the info byte to zero doesn't effect anything.
         The normal speed is 6.

Example: D-2 4F05 - Set speed to 5
         --- 0000
         E-1 0F00 - Nothing happens to speed.
         --- 0FC3 - Set speed to 3
         G-2 2F06 - Set normal speed

         If you load another song it will be played with the actual speed.
         All songs on these disk are re-written to their normal speeds.
         (by D.O.C)

The Playroutine.
----------------
The playroutine on the SoundTracker disk is for using your music in demos,
intros, games etc. It was written using the Seka-assembler and the source
of the routine can directly be incorporated in your demo/intro source.
When you are finished writing your music using SoundTracker, save it to
disk. Use the function 'SAVE MODULE'. You will find at the 'MODULES'-DIR
a file, which contains all muzakdatas and instruments. Load with SEKA
the source of the playroutine and enter the size of saved module at the
label 'DATA'.

The source of the player to Soundtracker 9 is in the directory: ST9
So to load this into SEKA type:-
	SEKA> ri [return]
	FILENAME> ST9/PLAY9  (Note from the RASTA CATCHA!)

Assemble. Now load the saved module to 'DATA'.
At the start of your program, call the 'START' routine.

Please note that the IX version of SoundTracker is not completely downwards
compatible with version V1.8. Any old V1.8 song that uses no portamento or
arpeggio can be used with IX without any problems. If arpeggio is used,
simply remove the 1 that selects the arpeggios in V1.8.
(Example : C#2 2184) If the old V1.8 song uses portamento, you will have to
rewrite this a little until it sounds the same as before.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONS AND HINTS :

- THE DIRECTORY FUNCTION WAS CHANGED IN TWO WAYS :
  1. You can abort the directory printing (right mouse button).
  2. Longer songnames will be printed and cleared in full length.

- HINT :
  ALLWAYS SET THE SPEED ON THE UPPERHALF OF THE SCREEN TO '120'.
  DO NOT CHANGE THE SPEED VALUE, COZ THE ROUTINE WORKS IN THE
  TIMER-INTERRUPT, AND IF YOU SET ANOTHER SPEED VALUE, THE
  INTERRUPT WILL SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN AND THAT'S NOT VERY USEFUL
  FOR DEMOS/INTROS/GAMES...
  THE ORIGINAL SPEED IS '120' AND THAT'S ONCE EVERY VERTICAL-BLANK.
  THE OTHER SPEED VALUE (EFFECT $0F) CAN BE USED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT
  ANY INFLUENCE TO ANY INTERRUPT.

- HINT :
  DO NOT PRESS RESET WHILE COMPOSING - OTHERWISE THE MUZAKDATAS ARE LOST
  (HAHA)

- ATTENTION :
  I (DR.MABUSE) just noticed that the our intro sometimes (only on the A-500)
  hangs up... A-1000 users will have no problems...
  WE the X-RAYZ took it off , so Soundtracker IX works ok.

Have joy, have fun, have seasons in the sun...
