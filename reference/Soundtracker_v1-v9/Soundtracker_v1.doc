Patterns.
---------

Any piece of music written with SoundTracker V2.0 is build up from patterns.
SoundTracker holds a table with information about the sequence in which
these parts must be played. With 'Position' you determine your position
in the table. With 'Pattern' you define what pattern to play at that
position. 'Length' defines the total size of the table.


The Keys.
---------
The keys on your Amiga have been grouped to represent the layout of a
two-octave piano-keyboard. You can "shift" the keyboard one octave up or
down with the aid of the F1 and F2 keys, thus incrementing the range of
the keyboard to three octaves.

While editing: Cursor-keys move cursor.
-------------- F6  - Set cursor to first line of pattern.
	       F7  - Set cursor to 16th line of pattern.
	       F8  - Set cursor to 32th line of pattern.
	       F9  - Set cursor to 48th line of pattern.
	       F10 - Set cursor to last line of pattern.
	       DEL - Delete note under cursor.
	       
		
Instruments.
------------

You can use up to fifteen different instruments in one music-piece.
Before you can use a sample as an instrument, some values must be defined.
You can do this by either using a preset, or by setting these values your-
self.

Length : This is simply the length of the used sample in bytes.

Volume : This is the default volume of that instrument.

Replen : When replen is set to 2, each instrument will be played once.
	 When replen is set to any other value, the instrument will be
	 repeated until an other note is played.

Repeat : SoundTracker can also be programmed to repeat just a part of a
	 sample constantly. This is usefull when playing waveforms. Whenever
	 Repeat is set to a non-zero value, SoundTracker will just play a
	 part of that particular sample. In this case Repeat defines the
	 offset and Replen the length of the part that must be repeated. 

Notes.
------
  
              C # 1  3 C 2 3
               /    /  |  \|
              /    /   |   Arpeggio, portamento and volume info.
             /    /  Command
            /   Inst#
         Note to
         be played.



Note    : This is simply the note that must be played by that particular
----      instrument.

Inst#   : This is the number of the instrument that must be used to play
-----     the note. When the instrument number is zero, the last selected
	  instrument will be used.

Command : This number tells SoundTracker what special functions must be
-------   preformed while playing the note.
	  These functions are as follows :

	  0 - Normal play or arpeggio.
	  1 - Portamento up.
	  2 - Portamento down.
	  3 - Modulate volume of next higher voice. (possibly with arpeggio)
	  4 - Modulate period of next higher voice. 	      ''
	  5 - Modulate period + volume of next higher voice.  ''
	  6 - Modulate volume of next higher voice and portamento up.	
	  7 - Modulate period of next higher voice and portamento up
	  8 - Modulate period + volume of next higher voice + portamento up.
	  9 - Modulate volume of next higher voice and portamento down.
	  A - Modulate period of next higher voice and portamento down.
	  B - Modulate period + vol of next higher voice + portamento down.

Info    : This byte contains the additional information for the commands.
----	  


Modulation : One voice can be programmed to modulate another. This means that
----------   either the volume, period or volume AND period are no longer
	     static values that are set before starting to play a note, but
	     that these are subject to change during play. It can be seen
	     that this provides a way to program viberato and tremolo
	     effects.
	     When a voice is programmed to modulate, it always modulates the
	     next voice. So voice1 modulates voice2, voice2 modulates voice3
	     and so on. When a voice is told to modulate another, that voice
	     is made silent. When voice4 is told to modulate, it is only made
	     silent, because there are no 'higher' voices than voice4.
	     How does this modulation work ? Well, say you programmed voice1
	     to modulate only the volume of voice2. The volume of voice2 is
	     no longer defined by the volume of that instrument. Instead, the
	     words in the sample of voice1 define the volume for voice2.
	     So if the sample of voice1 looked like this :
	     $0030,$0032,$0034 etc., the volume of voice2 would become $30,
	     then $32 and so on. This is used to introduce a viberato to
	     voice2. The period of voice1 defines the speed of this viberato
	     effect. 
	     When voice1 was programmed to modulate the period of voice2, the
	     words in the sample of voice1 would define the period of voice2.
	     When a voice is programmed to modulate the volume AND the period
	     of the next voice, the first word in the sample defines the
	     volume, the second the period, the third the volume again and so
	     on.

Arpeggio : Arpeggio is used for simulating accords. It does this by
--------   rapidly changing the notes while playing an instrument.
	   Arpeggios are selected whenever the info byte has a non-zero
	   value and no other commands are selected.
	   When arpeggios are used, SoundTracker looks five times during
	   the play of one note, at the information contained in the info
	   byte. Each nibble (4 bits) in this byte defines
	   how many notes SoundTracker must add to the the note currently
	   playing. In each of the five passes SoundTracker does the
	   following with the information contained in the info byte :
	 	
	   1 - Add the first nibble to the current note.

	   2 - Add the second nibble to the current note.

	   3 - Play the current note.

	   4 - Add the first nibble to the current note.

	   5 - Add the second nibble to the current note.

 
Portamento : Portamento is used for 'sliding' of the instrument.
----------   If portamento is in use, the information contained in
	     the info byte will be added to (or subtracted from) the period
	     of the note playing in each of the five passes.
	     Example : D#2 3208
		       --- 0208
		       --- 0208
		       --- 0210
			 etc.
	

The Playroutine.
----------------

The playroutine on the SoundTracker disk is for using your music in demos,
intros, games etc. It was written using the Seka-assembler and the source
of the routine can directly be incorporated in your demo/intro source.
When you are finished writing your music using SoundTracker, save it to
disk. Write down which instruments you have used. Now enter the
Seka-assembler and load the playroutine-source. At the end of the routine,
(below the 'mt_sampleinfo' label) create an empty block (with the blk
command) of suitable size to hold the song data. Now determine where you
want the samples of the instruments to appear in memory. (or create an extra
block to hold the sample data.) Put these addresses behind the 'move.l'
instruction in lines 35-49.
Assemble. Now load the saved song in the created block and the samples to
their correct addresses.
At the start of your program, call the 'mt_init' routine, and to play the
music, call the routine 'mt_music' once every vertical blanking interrupt.
	
The 'Speed' label at the start of the routine, defines the pace at which the
notes succeed each-other. ($1f4 is the default value used in SoundTracker.)
Please note that, the higher the number, the slower the playroutine becomes.
Also, the slower it becomes, the longer it takes to complete a pass through
the routine. Some samples cannot handle high speeds, so you will have to try
this out.  

As has been told before, the source-file of the routine can
directly be incorporated in your demo/intro-source. To minimize the
possibility of a 'Double Symbol' error, all labels used in the routine start
with 'mt_'. So, when writing your program, do not use any labels that start
with 'mt_'.
