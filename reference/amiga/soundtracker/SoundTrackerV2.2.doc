Patterns.
---------

Any piece of music written with SoundTracker 2.2 is build up from patterns.
SoundTracker holds a table with information about the sequence in which
these parts must be played. With 'Position' you determine your position
in the table. With 'Pattern' you define what pattern to play at that
position. 'Length' defines the total size of the table.


The Keys.
---------

The original (V1.8) version of the SoundTracker had a German keymap.
Version 2.2 supports a standard USA keymap and this ensures compatibility
with ALL Amigas.
The keyboard has been extended, try typing on the whole key-rows.
The keys on your Amiga have been grouped to represent the layout of a
two-octave piano-keyboard. You can "shift" the keyboard one octave up or
down with the aid of the F1 and F2 keys, this incrementing the range of
the keyboard to three octaves.

While editing:
--------------
               Cursor-keys move cursor.
       shift + Cursor-keys move cursor fast.
         alt + Cursor-keys move cursor fastest.
               F6  - Set cursor to first line of pattern.
               F7  - Set cursor to 16th line of pattern.
               F8  - Set cursor to 32th line of pattern.
               F9  - Set cursor to 48th line of pattern.
               F10 - Set cursor to last line of pattern.
               DEL - Delete note under cursor.
       shift + F3  - Cut track of current pattern and copy into copy-puffer.
       shift + F4  - Copy track of current pattern into copy-puffer.
       shift + F5  - Copy puffer to track of current pattern.
         alt + F3  - Cut the whole pattern and copy into copy-buffer.
         alt + F4  - Copy pattern into copy-puffer.
         alt + F5  - Copy puffer to current pattern.
      

Special keys:
------------
To quit the D.O.C-SoundTracker 2.2 point the mousepointer at 0,0 and press:

         alt + shift + left and right mousebutton together !!!!


Sample sort function:
---------------------
I've inserted a special sort function in the load-song routine, so you
needn't to be a DJ anymore.

Only the D.O.C-SoundTrackers 2.1 + 2.2 will load ALL Samples from the 
Disk 'ST-01', than from 'ST-02', than from 'ST-03' and so on.

Sample zero function:
---------------------
While edding-ting you're able to set the sample to the value zero (0!).
Press all mousebuttons (three at all) at the position of the sample-
gadgets (plus,minus = +,-). Now you can edit the pattern with the
sample 0 to prevent difficulties according to the volume (Frog's idea) !!!


Correct 'DisplayPattern' routine:
---------------------------------
The 'MasterSoundTracker V1.0' and the 'D.O.C-SoundTracker V2.0' had
a incorrect 'DisplayPattern' routine !!!  The highest bit of the command-
and infobyte had been deleted on screen, but not in the memory !!!!!!!!!!
I've discovered this bug and removed it.

Example:           Entered -  E-2 C2FF   <=- Correct !
         Printed out later -  E-2 427F   <=- Wrong instrument and infobyte !
           Still in memory -  E-2 C2FF   <=- Correct !


Instruments.
------------
You can use up to fifteen different instruments in one music-piece.
All instruments are listed in the preset-list. The volume is allways
64 but you can change it to each value between 0 and 64.
To change the other values of each instrument you have to load the
preset-editor. With that tool you can change the whole preset-list.
TIP improved the preset-editor : some values (Length,Repeat and RepeatLength)
have to be entered in hexadecimal !!! Now you can use samples up to
$8000 (=32768) bytes !!!! (Press right mouse-button to quit).

UNKNOWN corrected the preset-editor : It got a nice bug !  (Not TIP's fault)

Example: You've an instrument called 'HeavySynth' in your preset-list, now
         you want to INSERT an instrument with the name 'Heavy' in it.
         The preset-editor searches for the word 'HEAVY' in the list, find
         the name 'HEAVYsynth' and DELETES it to insert the name
         'Heavy' !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Of course I've discoverd and removed this bug, too.


Notes:
------
               C#1   3 C 2 3
               /    /  |  \|
              /    /   |   Arpeggio,portamento,volume,speed,filter and 
             /    /  Command                                   position info.
            /   Inst#
         Note to
         be played.



Note:     This is simply the note that must be played by that particular
-----     instrument.

Inst#:    This is the number of the instrument that must be used to play
------    the note. When the instrument number is zero, the last selected
          instrument will be used.

Command:  This number tells SoundTracker what special functions must be
--------  preformed while playing the note.

These functions are as follows:

     0 - Normal play or arpeggio.
     1 - Portamento up.
     2 - Portamento down.
     B - Position jump!
     C - Set volume.
     D - Pattern break!
     E - Set filter on/off
     F - Set speed.

Info:      This byte contains the additional information for the commands.
-----     

Arpeggio:  Arpeggio is used for simulating accords. It does this by
---------  rapidly changing the notes while playing an instrument.
           Arpeggios are selected whenever the info byte has a non-zero
           value and no other commands are selected.
           When arpeggios are used, SoundTracker looks five times during
           the play of one note, at the information contained in the info
           byte. Each nibble (4 bits) in this byte defines
           how many notes SoundTracker must add to the the note currently
           playing. In each of the five passes SoundTracker does the
           following with the information contained in the info byte :
       
           1 - Add the first nibble to the current note.

           2 - Add the second nibble to the current note.

           3 - Play the current note.

           4 - Add the first nibble to the current note.

           5 - Add the second nibble to the current note.

 
Portamento:  Portamento is used for 'sliding' of the instrument.
-----------  If portamento is in use, the information contained in
             the info byte will be added to (or subtracted from) the period
             of the note playing in each of the five passes.

   Example:  D#2 3208  Slides down $08
             --- 0208  Slides down $08
             --- 0108  Slides up $08
             --- 0210  Slides down $10 (=16)
             etc.

   
Position jump:
--------------
         The position jump command will do the same like the pattern break
         command, but the info byte gives the playroutine the no. of the
         position.

Example: E-2 3B04 - Break the pattern and jump to position 4
         --- 0000
         --- 0B06 - Break the pattern and jump to position 6


Volume:  One of the enhancements that the V2.2 version provides is the
-------  ability to change the volume at any time during play.
         When command $0C (=12) is selected, the volume is set to the value
         contained in the info byte. The volume will remain at this level
         until a next SAMPLE is played. At this time, the volume is
         reset to the default volume level of that sample.

Example: C#1 1C22 - Set volume to $22 (=34) and use instrument # 1 to
                    play the C#1 note.
         D-2 0000 - Use instrument # 1 to play the D-2 note.
                    (Volume level remains at $22 (=34))
         B-1 1000 - Use instrument # 1 to play the B-1 note and
                    set volume to default value for that
                    instrument.

Pattern break:
--------------
         Pattern break is used to create shorter patterns than 64 notes.
         The note with the $0D command will be played and after that
         the next pattern in the position-table will be played.

Example: A#3 1D00 - At this point the pattern interrupts.
         --- 0D00 - Look upper line.
         C-1 0D30 - Look upper line.


Filter:  This Soundtracker version allows you to turn the lo-pass filter
-------  on/off.

Example: G#2 1E01 - Turns the filter and the power-led off.
         --- 0000
         E-1 1E00 - Turns the filter and the power-led on.

Warning to all Amiga 1000 owners (like Unknown and Esteban):
Don't play with the power-led because some A500 and A2000 owners will
not be happy when they hear your song.


Speed:   This function allows changing the speed during play.
------   You can only enter a speed between 01 and 0F.
         Setting the info byte to zero doesn't effect anything.
         The normal speed is 6.

Example: D-2 4F04 - Set speed to 4
         --- 0000
         E-1 0F00 - Nothing happens to speed.
         --- 0FC3 - Set speed to 3
         G-2 2F06 - Set normal speed

         If you load another song it will be played with the actual speed.
         All songs on these disk are re-written to their normal speeds.
         (by D.O.C)

The Playroutine.
----------------
The playroutine on the SoundTracker disk is for using your music in demos,
intros, games etc. It was written using the Seka-assembler and the source
of the routine can directly be incorporated in your demo/intro source.
When you are finished writing your music using D.O.C-SoundTracker, save it
to Disk. Use the function 'SAVE MODULE'. You will find at the 'MODULES'-DIR
a file, which contains all muzakdatas and instruments. Load with SEKA
the source of the playroutine and enter the size of saved module at the
label 'mt_data'.
Assemble. Now load the saved module to 'mt_data'.

How to play a song:
-------------------
At the beginning of your program, call the 'mt_init' routine.
Each vertical blank jump to the 'mt_music' routine.
To stop the song jump to the 'mt_end' routine.

Please note that the V2.2 version of D.O.C-SoundTracker is completely 
downwards compatible with version V9.
