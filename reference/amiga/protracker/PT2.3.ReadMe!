Some info..
-----------

This disk contains all the necessary files to run Shell, CLI, and all the
most used CLI-Commands. It is possible to print songs, but we'we only
included the Generic printerdriver, so you'll have to install your own.
Remember to set the new printerdriver with Preferences. If you make your
own workdisk, remember to copy the commands "Run" and "EndCLI".

If you are going to make make a compact-disk containing Protracker, please 
include PT.help and powerpacker.library!!! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!

             DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EDIT THE HELP-FILE!!!

The first 1024 bytes are a text-offset index for Protracker, so keep off. 

For more info, press the HELP key when you have started Protracker.

It isn't possible to load old configuration files with PT2.3A, but if you
load an old config-file into an editor and change the first 5 letters to
"PT2.3", you might be able to use it, but some new functions may be set to
zero though. Remember to check the DMA-wait and all the other functions
or you'll experience some crashes etc...



--- Protracker history ---

First Version 1.0 (A) - Full of bugs...

Bugs corrected in V1.0 Release B:
---------------------------------
 - PatternLoop (It always jumped to the start of the pattern, not the loop)
 - Zap had put FineTune AND Glissando-Control in the same command! (E3)
 - Fade Up / Down caused shit and even a few gurus!
 - Delete Pos inserted pattern 77 (!) at position 127 in the song, causing
   it to be longer than 80k!
 - Filter All Samples was slow as hell because it tried to filter non-
   existant samples.
 - If you selected sample 0 from the keypad, it always played the last
   sample played as sample 0!
 - A590 harddisk owners couldn't use the keyboard because of the way Mahoney
   & Kaktus set up the keyboard interrupt (we used their NT1.1 routine).
 - Entering the help screen when in the midi screen fucked up the display.
 - Escaping from Mix exited from the whole edit op.!
 - CutBeg no longer fucks up the Sample length and Pos.
 - The help file was FULL of bugs / misspellings.

Bugs corrected in V1.0 Release C:
---------------------------------
 - Error in Finetune-table2 (note B-2)
 - Abort Load sometimes caused a guru!
 - Toneportamento (cmd 3) didn't work correctly with finetune.
 - PLST screen was one pixel off.

 MIDI screen was removed.


Changes and improvements from Protracker V1.0C to V1.1A:
--------------------------------------------------------

General:
  - Protracker will now run if you have Kickstart 2.0 installed!
    (A500, A1000, A2000, A3000 etc...)
  - Protracker will also "Auto runback" when you start from CLI!
    There's no need to use the 'run' command.
  - Keyboard and mouse input is provided by an InputHandler with prior-
    ity 52. The handler will grab all RAWKEY and RAWMOUSE events from
    the input.device before they reach intuition. PT will no longer
    interfere with windows and gadgets on the intuition screen behind.
  - Keyboard buffer. Wow!!! Now you can play really fast, and PT won't
    miss a single key (...well, not as many as it used to before...).
  - The vertical blank interrupt no longer patches the vector itself, but
    uses the AddIntServer function.
  - The playroutine creates it's own CIA or VBLANK interrupt, and it will
    not be removed if a song is playing when you go to CLI/Workbench.
  - Text input routine changed a little. Use mouse to set pos and to exit.
  - Improved "Out of memory" handling (hopefully no more gurus...).
  - Only the first 2 bytes of a sample will be zeroed (were the first 4).
  - Lots of new keyboard commands/shortcuts using the Alt key.
  - Vibrato depth changed to be compatible with NT2.0. Double all your
    depth numbers if you load old protracker songs.
  - Funk Repeat changed to Invert Loop (may trash your samples though).
  - Play samples from the keypad (dot mode) when pressing backslash.

Main Screen:
  - MIDI screen has been removed. Changed to sampler instead. MIDI input
    is still there, but there's no MIDI output. Sorry...
  - Quadrascope. Four channel oscilloscope that displays the samples
    in real-time, even when playing from keyboard. The good old spectrum
    analyzer is still there, just click on the scope to toggle.
  - Tempo gadget. Default is 125 BPM (normal vblank speed), but that can be
    changed if you select CIA timing on Setup2. Range is 32-255 BPM, and
    can also be changed with the 'F' effect command (speed/tempo).
  - Repeat and replen will be updated in the samples when you change them.
    You no longer have to press a key to hear the new loop.
  - Protracker should now be able to show up to 10/16 megs of freemem.
  - Error messages when PLST or Config not found.
  - Click to enter position, pattern and length with the keyboard.

Disk Op.:
  - Choose RAW or IFF when saving samples.
  - Samples can be saved with IFF-loops.
  - Change path without reading directory.
  - All 30 characters in filename/directory stored (was 24).
  - Shows directories, just click to add directory to path.
  - Parent directory gadget.
  - One preset and several default paths for modules/songs/samples.
  - PT will now read an "unlimited" number of directory entries (was 200).

Setup:
  - The only thing that's happened here is a small gadget labeled "2".
    Pressing it will put you in...

Setup2:
  - 8 new on/off toggles.
    Override: Load/save sample from samplepath even if there's a path
      in the samplename. ST-37:bigbadbass with override will be loaded
      from DF0: (or whatever) instead of ST-37:. You may want to put
      all your samples in one big directory on your harddisk...
    NoSamples: Will load a song without asking for the samples.
    BlankZero: This will show the samplenumbers in the pattern in the
      same way as Noisetracker 1.2 (Zeros are blanked out).
    Show Dirs: If on, directories will be shown in Disk Op.
    Show Publ: If on, PT will show all free Public memory, otherwise
      just free Chip memory.
    CutToBuff: If on, the part of the sample cut away in the sample
      editor will be saved in the copybuffer.
    Load Loop: Will load loops from an IFF file when loading a sample,
      or adding a path in the sampleeditor.
    Slow Mode: Use this toggle if you have a 25 Mhz A3000 where every-
      thing is faster. Turning it on might help.
  - Set Default paths.
  - You can set the maximum number of presets (used to be 2500).
  - DMA wait. Use this on 25MHz Amigas (normally 300, use 900 on A3000).
  - Set tuning tone (note and volume).
  - Select CIA or VBlank timing.
  - Set default CIA tempo.
  - Spectrum Analyzer/VU-meter copper color editor!

Preset Editor:
  - Use Preset removed, inserted Delete Disk instead.
  - You can now save Finetune instead of Volume in the PLST. 
  - ST-disk number changed to hex (ST-00 --> ST-FF)!
  - Adding samples with IFF-loops to the presetlist is possible.
  - Proper PLST allocation. Protracker will no longer allocate
    any memory if there's no PLST.
 
PLST:
  - ST-disk number changed to HEX. This means you can have
    up to $FF, or 255 ST-disks (used to be 99).

Sampler/Sample Editor:
  - Sample Graphing like Audiomaster. With Show Range, Show All,
    Zoom Out, Range All, etc...
  - Play either Waveform, Display or Range.
  - Repeat points are shown, and can be dragged around.
  - Loop on/off toggle.
  - A line shows current position when playing back a sample.
  - A sampler just like on NT2.0.
  - Resample function w/tuning tone.
  - Cut, Copy and Paste functions.
  - Cursor to beginning/end.
  - Swap current sample with copybuffer.

Edit Op.:
  1 - Transpose All bug removed.
  2 - Move changed to Copy (use this to copy samples too).
  3 - Upsample changed a tiny bit (allocation).
  3 - Most functions will now work with marked ranges.

Bugfixes and changes from PT1.1A to PT1.1B:
-------------------------------------------

- Load gadget no longer hangs the program when trying to load a file that
  doesn't exist.
- Better filehandling with error messages.
- Repeat and replen check installed (Rel. A hanged when replen accidentally
  got the value zero).
- Repeat and replen were swapped when loading an IFF sample.
- Only RepLen values in IFF samples were added in the preset-editor.
- Tune memory wasn't always updated when editing samples.
- Swap Buffer debugged.
- The arpeggio sounded weird because the pitch wasn't set back at the
  right time.
- Shift speeds up the scrolling in the PLST and preset-editor.

---------------------------------------------------------

  has now been fixed.
- You are now able to fastscroll the file- and presetlist to the next
  startcharacter.Try it out yourselves...hard to explain.

- PT now reads the dir after rename/save/delete if the Autodirtoggle is on.
- You can solo a channel with the mouse by holding the right mousebutton
  while pressing 1,2,3 or 4.
- You can pass an argument from workbench/shell/cli to automatically load
  a module when PT starts.
- Powerpacker crunching/decrunching with powerpacker.library!
  PT will automaticly append/remove ".pp" to/from the filename.
- You can save an Icon together with the module.

------------------------------------------------
Bugfixes and improvements from PT2.1A to PT2.2A:
------------------------------------------------

- I have fixed the chip-mem bug from PT2.1A.(it didn't work with chipmem only)
- When Preset-ed screen was shown,you couldn't use the gadgets on the lower
  part of the main- or sample-screen.
- When autoexitdirtoggle was off,PT didn't change the songname when you loaded
  a new song/module until you exit from disk op.
- If you resampled a sample with big difference between the tunetone and the
  resampletone then the new length was incorrectly computed.
- If you ran out of memory when allocating crunchbuffersize then ... software
  failure! This should work just fine now.
- If you loaded a sample with a '.' in the samplename then PT set the length
  incorrectly in some cases (see below)
- Save module should work fine now.(another nasty bug is swept away!)
- The Sampler works fine on ks2.0 (This version tests diskactivity before
  sampling, PT1.3 doesn't!)
  ***********************************************************************
  * Thanks to Matrix/LSD for sending the working piece of source to me! *
  ***********************************************************************
- The timer is updated when you play a song while jumping out to Workbench.
- The Loopsprites are working fine with screenadjust.
- Stepplay works fine now. Amiga+Backspace is gone though.
- MIDI in functions are working now, I hope!
- Inputhandler debugged a little.
- ShowFreeDiskGadget debugged (again). Before it showed 2 sectors too much.
- If you pressed the deletefile gadget and then pressed a directoryname in
  the list then the dir was added to the path but the directory wasn't opened.
  This is now fixed.
- PrintSong now prints the patternlist with decimal values. It prints all
  patterns.(Older versions of PT missed to print the highest pattern)
- I have implemented a chord maker.
- I have implemented e Position-Editor.
- On request, I have made ''multitasking'' like in PT1.3.
- ProTracker has it's own screen. When the PT screen is in front of all other
  screens, PT will wake up.
- The browse function is modified to act like PT1.3. It shows the current
  devices and disknames.
- If you hold the right mousebutton while pressing the browsegadget a disklist
  will pop up showing all the device- and disknames from the browsegadget in
  the filenamewindow. Pressing a name will autoload that directory.
- If you press LeftShift+any key 0-9 a-z while in DiskOp,  PLST or PresetEd,
  PT will move you to the position in the list with a name beginning with the
  corresponding character.
- If you use MIDI I've added two new keys. A-2 and B-2 on the Synthkeyboard
  are used as SampleNumber Up/Down! I have also Transposed the MIDInotes input
  one octave down (because Dolphin has a small keyboard and couldn't access
  the upper octave,C#3 - B-3).
- I have added a SaveExecutable option.
- 9 new toggles.

------------------------------------------------
Bugfixes and improvements from PT2.2A to PT2.3A:
------------------------------------------------
-Mountlist in PLST is fixed. Before it asked for disks in all drives even if
 you didn't have extradrives.

-Helpfile fixed. In the betaversion the jumptable was corrupt.

-Pointer color was green after succesful saving. This one is fixed now.

-In the betaversion you couldn't exit POS-ed with ESC.

-PT shouldn't quit with ESC. This is fixed now. Use Alt+Q (This one has been
 there all the time) or click in the top-left corner to quit.

-There was a bug in the Entry jump routine (Shift+Desired character) in
 Disk.op, PLST and PresetED. If you had directories in the current path
 PT jumped to the first DIRECTORY starting with the desired character instead
 of searching for the first FILE beginning with that character.

-Some minor bugs fixed as well.



Known bugs, errors, stupid things and other crap:
-------------------------------------------------

- If you load a song or module that's not a proper ST-module,
  Protracker may trash the upper left of the screen and/or crash.
  This screen-trashing may also happen other times. Don't ask us why
  or when. There is really no proper way to check if a file is a module
  or song. We check for "M.K." at offset 1080, and if isn't found,
  Protracker asks if you want to load it with 31 samples, since it may
  be a Startrekker module. If you answer no, PT assumes it's an old
  15 samples song/module.

- If you format a disk with Protracker, it's possible to save files to the
  disk, but if you try to load the files you just saved, nothing comes up
  in the disk op. screen.  If could be that the Amiga has some problems
  validating the disk, but there are no such messages. We'll have a look
  at the Format routine.If you get any problems, try to take out the disk
  and insert it again.PT should now re-read the dir.

- You cannot have two presets with the same name on different ST-disks.

- I have noticed that powerpacker.library crunches some samples/modules
  improperly. (This goes with the powerpacker program as well).
  Be sure to check the packed files before you delete the sourcefiles!
