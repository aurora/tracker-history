Bugs fixed in PT2.3A Final
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mountlist in PLST is fixed. Before it asked for disks in all drives even if
you didn't have extradrives.

Helpfile fixed. In the betaversion the jumptable was corrupt.

Pointer color was green after succesful saving. This one is fixed now.

In the betaversion you couldn't exit POS-ed with ESC.

PT shouldn't quit with ESC. This is fixed now. Use Alt+Q (This one has been
there all the time) or click in the top-left corner to quit.

There was a bug in the Entry jump routine (Shift+Desired character) in
Disk.op, PLST and PresetED. If you had directories in the current path
PT jumped to the first DIRECTORY starting with the desired character instead
of searching for the first FILE beginning with that character.

Some minor bugs fixed as well.

There is a lock function which was implemented in PT2.2A, but never
explained in the helpfiles. Here we go:
If you type lock, PT will ask you to type a password (max 8 chars) and press
return. If you write the maximum 8 chars, you don't have to press return.
PT will now be locked until you type the password again. If a song was
playing when you typed lock then it will continue to play until you type
the password and stop the song or someone turns the power off! Remember
your password!
Note: this can be used against you. Always save your work before you visit
      the toilet or your little brother might lock PT and your module never
      gets saved. (I take no responsibility for your little brothers actions)

Bugs fixed in PT2.2A Beta:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have fixed the chip-mem bug from PT2.1A. (it didn't work with chip-mem only)

When Preset-ed screen was shown,you couldn't use the gadgets on the lower
part of the main- or sample-screen.

When autoexitdirtoggle was off, PT didn't change the songname when you loaded
a new song/module until you exit from disk op.

If you resampled a sample with big difference between the tunetone and the
resampletone then the new length was incorrectly computed.

If you ran out of memory when allocating crunchbuffersize then ... software
failure! This should work just fine now.

If you loaded a sample with a '.' in the samplename then PT set the length
incorrectly in some cases (see below)

Save module should work fine now.(another nasty bug is swept away!)

The Sampler works fine on ks2.0 (This version tests diskactivity before
sampling, PT1.3 doesn't!)
 ***********************************************************************
 * Thanks to Matrix/LSD for sending the working piece of source to me! *
 ***********************************************************************

The timer is updated when you play a song while jumping out to Workbench.

The Loopsprites are working fine with screenadjust.

Stepplay works fine now. Amiga+Backspace is gone though.

MIDI in functions are working now, I hope!

Inputhandler debugged a little.

ShowFreeDiskGadget debugged (again). Before it showed 2 sectors too much.

If you pressed the deletefile gadget and then pressed a directoryname in
the list then the dir was added to the path but the directory wasn't opened.
This is now fixed.

PrintSong now prints the patternlist with decimal values. It prints all
patterns.(Older versions of PT missed to print the highest pattern)

I have on request from Sun/Dreamdealers implemented a chord maker.
Just press chord in edit op. 3 and you will see a new window for making chords.


The gadgets:
------------

* Chord
will make the chord, using the current sample and the notes chosen, and the
chord will be put in the current sample or a free sample,depending on your
choice (see below)

* Reset
will reset the notes and the length

* Undo
will undo the last change. (apart from multiple arrow up/down)

* Length
will set the length to the maximum value, depending on the length of the
original sample and the notes you choose.This will ofcourse set the ':'
after the 4 lengthdigits (see below)
Holding the right mousebutton will set the length to the minimum depending
on the notes chosen. '.' will be shown after the 4 digits. Mixing with the
minimum length will make the sample as long as the shortest sample of the 4
resampled notes.

* Major
will set a major chord, depending on the basenote.

* Minor
will set a minor chord, depending on the basenote.

* Sus-4
will set a sus-4 chord, depending on the basenote

* Length string gadget
will wait for you to enter a new length (not greater than the maxlength.
If you want a longer sample then add more space after the mix has been done.)
The ':' after the 4 digits shows that the samplelength is set to its maximum!

* Major7
will set a major7 chord, depending on the basenote.

* Minor7
will set a minor7 chord, depending on the basenote.

* Major6
will set a major6 chord, depending on the basenote.

* Minor6
will set a minor6 chord, depending on the basenote.

* 4 notegadgets
The upper one is the basenote.If you press a gadget, PT will wait for you to
press a note.Holding the right mousebutton will reset the note

* 4 Up/Down gadgets
will add/sub 1 halfnote from the current note.Holding right button will
add/sub 1 octave.You can reset the note by adding past B-3.

* The 4 rightmost gadgets
works just like the edit op gadgets. 1,2,3 takes you to the corresponding
edit option, and E exits

* The statusline
pressing the upper line will toggle between New or Old sample:
If N, then PT will search for an free sample to put the result.
If O, then PT will put the result on the current sample, overwriting the
original sample

Note1!
------
This version of PT resets repeat and replen. PT also puts a '!' last in the
samplename to show you that this is a chord sample.The '!' is for you to see
where the destination-sample has gone,it has nothing to do with the program.
You can take the '!' away and rename the sample to ...-major , ...-minor etc
for instance.

Note2!
------
The chosen option on the statusline in edit op. 3 ,H(alve) or C(lip)
will affect the chord resampling and mixing!

Ok, that was the chord gadgets!

***********************************************************************

Position-Editor
---------------
Press 'POS' on the mainscreen to get to the Position-Editor.
All the gadgets should be well known, pressing the big gadget at the
top will stop the song. Keyboard input works too,Left Alt,Left Amiga,space
and the cursor up/down arrows.You can use the Position,pattern and length
gadgets on the main screen, or click in the list to alter the current
pattern or to enter a name to each pattern if you'd like to.
The Patternnames will be loaded/saved if you have the corresponding toggles
ON (load names,save names). The files will have the mod. exchanged to mod!
just to distuingish them from the real modules. The patternnames will be
cleared if you choose clear song or clear all.Another way is to click on
each name you'd like to clear and then press the right mouse button.
Patternplay works a little different from in the mainscreen.The pattern
shown on the edit-row(the current position) will be played instead of the
pattern currently shown in the notedatawindow.

HEY! The patternnames has no effect on the module, they are just to remind
the musician of the contents of the patterns, eg. you can name the first
three patterns to INTRO just to remind yourself that those three patterns
are the intro to your tune!

***********************************************************************

Other NEW things:
-----------------

On request, I have made ''multitasking'' like in PT1.3. I am not sure if
this works correctly, but i have tested it a lot without trouble.
LeftAmiga+N, LeftAmiga+M should work fine.


ProTracker has it's own screen. When the PT screen is in front of all other
screens, PT will wake up.


The browse function is modified to act like PT1.3. It shows the current
devices and disknames.
If you hold the right mousebutton while pressing the browse gadget a disklist
will pop up showing all the device- and disknames from the browsegadget in the
filenamewindow. Pressing a name will autoload that directory. If there are
more than eight entries, just use the arrow up/down keys or the up/down
gadgets.


If you press LeftShift+any key 0-9 a-z while in DiskOp,
PLST or PresetEd, PT will move you to the position in the list with a name
beginning with the corresponding character.If not found you will end up in
the end of the list.


If you use MIDI I've added two new keys. A-2 and B-2 on the Synthkeyboard
are used as SampleNumber Up/Down! I have also Transposed the MIDInotes input
one octave down (because one of my friends had a small keyboard and couldn't
access the upper octave,C#3 - B-3).


On request from 'The green Lark/Aliens' I have added a SaveExecutable option.
Hold the right mousebutton while pressing save module. This will remove
'mod.' from the filename and add '.exe', and save the file in the current
modules-dir. This won't crunch the module though.


9 new toggles: (all of them isn't working at the moment)
--------------
* Salvage
* 100 Patterns
* Save Icons
* Load PatternNames
* Save PatternNames
* Load PLST when starting PT
* Screen Adjust
* Save IFF/Raw packed sample
* System Requests

You can now have modules with 100 patterns. If you save a module with more
than 64 patterns then M.K. in the moduleheader will be changed to M!K!
