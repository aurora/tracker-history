Bugfixes and improvements from PT2.2A to PT2.3A:
------------------------------------------------
-Mountlist in PLST is fixed. Before it asked for disks in all drives even if
 you didn't have extradrives.

-Helpfile fixed. In the betaversion the jumptable was corrupt.

-Pointer color was green after succesful saving. This one is fixed now.

-In the betaversion you couldn't exit POS-ed with ESC.

-PT shouldn't quit with ESC. This is fixed now. Use Alt+Q (This one has been
 there all the time) or click in the top-left corner to quit.

-There was a bug in the Entry jump routine (Shift+Desired character) in
 Disk.op, PLST and PresetED. If you had directories in the current path
 PT jumped to the first DIRECTORY starting with the desired character instead
 of searching for the first FILE beginning with that character.

-Some minor bugs fixed as well.

------------------------------------------------
Bugfixes and improvements from PT2.1A to PT2.2A:
------------------------------------------------

- I have fixed the chip-mem bug from PT2.1A.(it didn't work with chipmem only)
- When Preset-ed screen was shown,you couldn't use the gadgets on the lower
  part of the main- or sample-screen.
- When autoexitdirtoggle was off,PT didn't change the songname when you loaded
  a new song/module until you exit from disk op.
- If you resampled a sample with big difference between the tunetone and the
  resampletone then the new length was incorrectly computed.
- If you ran out of memory when allocating crunchbuffersize then ... software
  failure! This should work just fine now.
- If you loaded a sample with a '.' in the samplename then PT set the length
  incorrectly in some cases (see below)
- Save module should work fine now.(another nasty bug is swept away!)
- The Sampler works fine on ks2.0 (This version tests diskactivity before
  sampling, PT1.3 doesn't!)

  * Thanks to Matrix/LSD for sending the working piece of source to me! *

- The timer is updated when you play a song while jumping out to Workbench.
- The Loopsprites are working fine with screenadjust.
- Stepplay works fine now. Amiga+Backspace is gone though.
- MIDI in functions are working now, I hope!
- Inputhandler debugged a little.
- ShowFreeDiskGadget debugged (again). Before it showed 2 sectors too much.
- If you pressed the deletefile gadget and then pressed a directoryname in
  the list then the dir was added to the path but the directory wasn't opened.
  This is now fixed.
- PrintSong now prints the patternlist with decimal values. It prints all
  patterns.(Older versions of PT missed to print the highest pattern)
- I have implemented a chord maker.
- I have implemented e Position-Editor.
- On request, I have made ''multitasking'' like in PT1.3.
- ProTracker has it's own screen. When the PT screen is in front of all other
  screens, PT will wake up.
- The browse function is modified to act like PT1.3. It shows the current
  devices and disknames.
- If you hold the right mousebutton while pressing the browsegadget a disklist
  will pop up showing all the device- and disknames from the browsegadget in
  the filenamewindow. Pressing a name will autoload that directory.
- If you press LeftShift+any key 0-9 a-z while in DiskOp,  PLST or PresetEd,
  PT will move you to the position in the list with a name beginning with the
  corresponding character.
- If you use MIDI I've added two new keys. A-2 and B-2 on the Synthkeyboard
  are used as SampleNumber Up/Down! I have also Transposed the MIDInotes input
  one octave down (because Dolphin has a small keyboard and couldn't access
  the upper octave,C#3 - B-3).
- I have added a SaveExecutable option.
- 9 new toggles.
