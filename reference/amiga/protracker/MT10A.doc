Short: MaxTracker V1.0, Release A

 Another Protracker's clone, which should works fine on all Amigas.

 It allows you to PLAY MODULES EVEN IN FAST-Memory, when XDMA Mode is on
 ( Setup 2 screen ) , and DMAWait can be done without any processor loop,
 so samples play even with a 68040/25 or 33Mhz.

 Tested on Amigas from A500 to A4000/40, KickStart 1.2 to 3.0,
 ChipSet SCS,ECS and AGA.

 Just a little trouble with AGA & MultiSync screens ... See the MT.Readme!

( I don't aim at making a new clone of Protracker...
  ...But there are some features in MaxTracker I would like in the next
  Protracker ! (Then MaxTracker will be useless...)
  [ FAST-Mem player, DMAWait with processor, Keyboard recognition,
    Correct MIDI routines :-> , ... ] )
