This program has been tested on all Amigas, KickStart from 1.2 to 3.0,
 ChipSet SCS,ECS and AGA.

Known bugs:
 - The sampler bugs sometimes ... like in PT2.0 ;-)

All other bugs should have been removed.

For AGA Users: (With MultiSync screen)
--------------
If MaxTracker Screen display is strange, then press Ctrl-N (NewDisplay),
and it will works fine...
