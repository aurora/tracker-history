This file contains the history of MED/OctaMED:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The history of MED began, when I got DOC SoundTracker VI in 1989.
I found that it was really easy to compose with it, but the program
itself was terrible: No multitasking, no Kickstart 1.3, no way to
exit (or was there??? there was no instructions), no keyboard
equivalents...

Today Protracker 1.1b is giving good competition, but it still can't
multitask, and it doesn't work under Kickstart 2.0 (V37.175).

== Version 1.00 - 1.11 (spring - summer 1989) ===========================
Not released... V1.0 looks quite pitiful :-)

== Version 1.12 (autumn 1989) ===========================================
This is the first released version (on Fish #255). It contained some
mysterious bugs that crashed the machine sometimes... I never found them,
but they are gone now (maybe they were compiler bugs).

== Version 2.00 (8 Apr 1990) ============================================
The version V2.00 was the second released version. When I started to
program it, I thought it'll be V1.20. But finally the list of improvements
grew so large that I decided it must be V2.00!! And here's the the list of
the new features/fixes:
   - Nearly completely rewritten code
   - New player routine made in assembler
   - Fast screen rendering routines also made in assembler
   - New user interface with file requester
   - MIDI support and up to 16 tracks
   - Extended keyboard, lots of new keyboard equivalents
   - Two equalizers (yes, imitating SoundTracker...)
   - Insert/delete to playing sequence list
   - Insert/delete blocks
   - Cut/Copy/Paste rectangular regions
   - Transposing and expanding/shrinking blocks
   - SoundTracker module load support
   - SoundTracker song saving
   - Can write icon with song
   - "MOD" save (song + samples)
   - Writes object files for your own programs
   - Song packing (not a real packer, but maybe "optimizing save routine")
   - More octaves (5)
   - Supports IFF 3- and 5-octave instruments
   - New commands (filter on/off, note off, stop playing, repeat note)
   - Repeat with beginning offset 0 works
   - "Quick note" feature
   - Insert effects when entering notes with Left or Right Alt
   - An option to turn off automatic advancing to next line
   - And maybe something else I've forgotten to put here...

== Version 2.01 (10 Apr 1990) ===========================================
Not a long time from previous release!!! I found few bugs:
In Finnish version, version 2.00 didn't save the song to correct directory.
In both versions, the icon did not go to correct directory.
These are now fixed. What a pity I sent Fred Fish V2.00 (yes, the letter
was posted today...my luck!!).

== Version 2.10 (17 Jul 1990) ===========================================
Again lots of new features...
   - max. 63 samples
   - block length is modifiable (1 - 256 lines)
   - relative volumes for each channel and master volume
   - samplelist
   - new commands (3, 4, B, FFA, FFB, FFD)
   - new MIDI commands (modulation wheel, pan, hold pedal)
   - saves now Sound/NoiseTracker modules (ST-song save removed)
   - programmable keys (Shift 0 - 9) can be edited/saved
   - real-time sample display (updated every frame), looks nice
   - new file format: module (MMD0)
   - intelligent sample loader, minimizes disk swapping, doesn't
     reload samples which are already in memory
   - automatic slide making (+ volume fade)
   - track numbers always displayed, can be scrolled one track at a
     time
   - free memory can be displayed
   - screen outlook a bit better (more space for sample name),
     many panels enhanced
   - an option to read volumes when entering notes with MIDI
   - each sample can be independently transposed (like play-transpose)
   - it's possible to highlight lines (reversed colors) for easier
     positioning of notes
   - the player tries to flush "serial.device" if allocation failed
   - delete option in file requester
   - volumes (command C) can be hex or decimal
   - blocks can be splitted or joined (thanks to modifiable size)
   - filename paths can be added/removed when loading samples
   - better compatibility mode for ST/NT
   - detaches from CLI (uses cback.o)
   - a bug in MIDI preset changing fixed
   - small enhancements everywhere

Also there's a new version of MEDPlayer, better instructions (I hope)
 better playroutine, "medplayer.library", module loader.......

== Version 2.11 (21 Jul 1990) ===========================================
This version contains two small fixes to the previous version:
   - MED now doesn't insert entered MIDI notes with volume 0
     (because it means "note off")
   - a very, very small bug fixed (when loading MMD0-module, instrument
     names were not always deleted)

== Version 2.12 (25 Jul 1990) ===========================================
   - MED had a bug which affected command FFF with MIDI. It's now fixed.
     The "modplayer.a" was correct, however. (strange...)
   - There should be no files missing from the source archive any more
     (due to a bug in Lharc or me).

== Version 2.13 (24 Sep 1990) ===========================================
   - MED loads now all 8 colors...
   - Block display correctly cleared after "Clr song only".

== Version 3.00 (31 Jan 1991) ===========================================
New major version featuring:
   - built-in sample editor with sample handling/sampling abilities
   - simple (C64-style) synthsounds, built-in editor
   - "hybrid"-instruments (sample with synthsound "programming language")
   - MED now uses CIAB timers instead of CIAA. This means that MED is now
     compatible with Kickstart 2.0.
   - better sample list
   - an alternative note-display method (more graphical) REMOVED IN V3.10!!
   - play-length timer
   - enhanced file-requester (no need to wait until all names loaded,
     can list devices/assigns)
   - better control over playing speed (now TWO tempo-selection gadgets,
     (leading to minor compatibility problems with previous versions))
   - option to start playing when a key has been hit (for real-time rec)
   - real-time recording works a bit better
   - "jump-to-last-used-sample-slot"-gadget
   - Hold/Decay implemented, allows accurate control over note
     duration (+ automatic decay after note end). THANKS TO ZAP FOR THE IDEA!
   - Insert Line/Delete Line -gadgets
   - an option to use space bar as an empty note (DEL)
   - 2×-option removed. Now there's "Spc" (space can be modified)
   - keypad working changed (can be used as track on/off switch or
     selecting instrument)
   - now a range of notes (instead of just a single note) can be assigned
     to Shift 0-9
   - many other options are now also saved when saving keys (screen
     colors etc.), they're loaded as defaults during start-up
   - an option to use note B instead of H (in some countries (like Finland)
     it's H, in others (like USA) it's B)
   - Workbench screen can be opened/closed from MED
   - MED can be synced externally (through MIDI), or MED can send MIDI-
     sync pulses
   - active sensing msgs can be switched off
   - gadgets to reset pitchbenders/modulation/presets, send MIDI-reset,
     and turn local control on/off
   - MIDI-input channel can be specified (or data can be received from
     all channels)
   - MIDI key-up can be received (especially for long notes...)
   - range for all editing operations can be selected with mouse
     (dragging using right button) and is displayed
   - it's possible to select individually tracks used in editing ops
   - affection of editing ops can be selected:
       song/block/selected tracks/current track/range, current instr/all
   - it's possible to change/exchange notes individually e.g. F-2 => E-3
   - instrument numbers can be changed or notes with a specified instr
     number can be deleted
   - it's possible to type a short "anno" text, that contains e.g. song
     name, composer, ©... It's displayed when file is loaded (in MED and
     MEDPlayer)
   - option to automatically advance to many directions (up, down,
     next track, prev. track, next num, prev. num)
   - notes in one track can be "spread" to many tracks, similar to
     "polyphonize" in NoiseTracker...
   - chord-entering mode (the tracks that are used in chord can be
     selected)
   - tracks can be turned on/off by clicking the track on the note
     display
   - gadgets to turn on/off all tracks, and select all tracks
   - player recognizes new commands:
     8 = set hold/decay for note
     9 = change secondary tempo
   - samples can be saved in IFF-format (optional)
   - outlook is now a bit better (gadgets are bigger etc...)

== Version 3.10 (14 Apr 1991) / OctaMED Version 1.00 (02 Apr 1991) ======
New features in OctaMED:
   - 8 channel playing with Amiga audio (like Oktalyzer etc...)
   - 8 tracks can be displayed at a time
New features in both OctaMED and MED:
   - new look (in MED-res 640 x 200/256), looks more professional
   - volumes in Instr-panel are displayed in both hex and decimal
   - expand and shrink space can be controlled
   - option to use 4-color screen (8 colors are quite slow on std Amiga
     especially in 8-channel mode)
   - option to load 8-channel samples in fast memory (mostly for listening
     only, as they can't be played from keyboard)
   - changing play rate and pitch in sample editor is easier
   - sample editor contains a delta-filter that can reduce noise
   - changing play rate and stretching in synth-editor now do some
     anti-aliasing
   - status line contains a button (CHRD) to activate/deactivate chord mode
   - backspace key can be used to delete/insert editing of notes
   - horizontal note display of MED 3.00 was removed
   - many MED 3.00 bugs (hopefully) fixed including:
     * Ext Sync (caused an instant travel to India)
     * Synth editor range dragging (trashed the screen in some instances)
     * MODULE SAVING (MED 3.00 didn't always align the fields, causing
       terrible results (Guru 00000003) with programs using modplayer.a)
     * Hybrid sound saving in object files
     * More reliable old ST-song loader. Doesn't necessarily crash when
       loading e.g. text files (but don't count on this!!).

== Version 3.11 (07 May 1991) ===========================================
Minor perfections and bug fixes:
   - timer reset gadget area fixed (yes, you can reset the timer by clicking
     on it!!)
   - new Boost-option in the sample editor (the opposite of the Filter)
   - only Left-Alt+Cursor up/down now moves you to the 1st/last block (to
     avoid accidental jump when using Alt+Cursor left/right)
   - no more "Loading synthetic sound..." messages during module/sng+samples
     load
   - a bug in the player routine command 3 (slide) fixed (in certain
     conditions the period got down to $ffff....)
*** Release 3.11b (09 May 1991) / OctaMED Version 1.01 (20 May 1991)
   Some more fixes (these bugs were totally harmless, but I'm a perfectionist)
   - in addition: keyboard shortcuts of Cut/Copy/Paste range now work.
     They are Ctrl-X (Cut), Ctrl-C (Copy) and Ctrl-V (Paste).

== OctaMED Version 2.00 (17 Aug 1991) / MED Version 3.20 (25 Aug 1991) ==
New features in OctaMED:
   - Notation editor/printer.
   - 5 - 7 channel modes. These allow you to use high quality, non-CPU-
     stressing audio and splitted channels at the same time.
   - 16 track display (for MIDI use).
New features in both OctaMED and MED:
   - numerous bugs fixed!! (including some nasty ones).
   - MED_paths can be now loaded.
   - insertion/deletion of tracks is possible.
   - DEF gadgets for New block and New here create 64-line 4/8 track blocks
   - MIDI note-off messages can be suppressed for a particular instrument
   - there can be multiple songs in memory at once, sharing instruments,
     can be saved as a multi-module.
   - new synthsound commands: envelope, set vibrato waveform.
   - proper loop markers in the sample editor.
   - no more "Sample too short" messages in the sample editor: the display
     is no longer limited to minimum of 624 bytes (the minimum is now 1 byte).
   - the sample editor can generate noise (e.g. for wind/sea effects).
   - a range in sample editor can be transferred to the synthsound editor.
   - the "red line" in the sample editor.
   - sample list displays the total number of samples in dir/memory.
   - the MIDI works now better: commands are handled BEFORE sending out
     notes, notes with volume 0 are not sent out, some new commands:
	channel/polyphonic aftertouch, pitchbender setting, controller
	change
   - most of the graphics data is now loaded into fast ram, giving more
     chip ram for samples (in addition, the S2FST switch was removed).
   - the range is now visible also on 2 bitplane-screen.
   - direct object saving removed - removing this seldom used feature
     made the program a couple of Kbytes shorter. There's now another
     method for incorporating modules into programs (requires a bit more
     work, though).
   - Topi, the jumping pointer, is now hidden if Jump setting is turned off.
     You can also save this (click Save prefs). Perhaps I'll "kill" Topi
     completely in the future (frees a couple of Kbytes)...
   - when you real-time enter with SPC on, the notes will be now quantized
     correctly.
   - an option to use the most common Protracker keyboard functions.

== OctaMED V2.00 release B (21 Aug 1991) ================================
   - a slight bug in the player routine audio channel freeing code fixed
     (didn't mark the channels as freed, could cause a crash in certain
      cases).
   - some slight cleanup in OctaMEDPlayer.

== Small bug fixes (16 Oct 1991) ========================================
   - "medplayer.library" now clears the _modnum during GetPlayer().
   - A minor bug in modplayer.a signal freeing code fixed.

== MED Version 3.21 (01 Jan 1992, Happy New Year :-) ====================
A bug fix release of MED V3.2. Many bugs fixed, including:
   - if SPC was set to 0, a Guru appeared.
   - Range All + Show Range trashed the screen.
   - volume arrow gadgets had incorrect widths in their Gadget structs.
   - problems with saving extension struct in multi-modules...hopefully
     cured.
   - a minor bug found in synth editor JVS renumbering code.

WARNING: A deadly bug found in MED 3.20 player stuff
         (MEDPlayer/modplayer.a/medplayer.library). The bug can cause
         problems when playing multi-modules or old (pre-3.00) modules.
         Be sure to use the new versions from now on!
         (Also, some minor bugs have been exterminated.)
