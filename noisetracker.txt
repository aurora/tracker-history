#                       - This tracker is non-polluting -

# Text by Mahoney ...
# 
# Since I'm so tired of the old ST-instructions, I'll just short take my part
# of the improvements here. If you're not into how to use the Soundtracker, read
# the old V2.3 instructions, or call your nearest friend. (that's what friends
# are for!) This tracker was made to fit our purposes, if you don't like it,
# that's not our problem.
# 
# Here's a short list of what I've done ...
# 
# * Removed the Format Disk-option (It wasn't reliable)
# * Inserted Load Sample-function (good if haven't done a PLST!)
# * Corrected the replayroutine (now works with all instruments)
# * An IFF-handler routine (should take damaged IFFs, too)
# * Improved inputhandler.
# * Reinserted song-pack on/off (I used it in the Sounds of Gnome)
# * Possibility to change the Module-directory.
# * Change instrument with the numeric-pad.
# * Play/Patt/Stop/Edit/Rec from the keyboard.
# * Simple transpose-function.
# * Two new song-commands (tone-portamento & vibrato)
# * Great PLST-screen with simple searchroutine.
# * Now you can change PLST in the tracker.
# * Change Pattern & Position from the keyboard.
# * Sounds looped just like in Audiomaster & Sound FX.
# * Modulelength & free chipmem displayed.
# * All known bugs corrected.
