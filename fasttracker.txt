# http://www.soundtrackers.de/trackers_without_frames.html notes:
#
# - this version has been brought to the public by Andreas Viklund and has
#   not been officially released by StarBreeze
# - IMPORTANT FOR GUS & GUS PnP users: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS RELEASE - IT
#   DOESN'T WORK WITH GUS!
# - internal revision history tells about AMD Interwave (GUS PnP) support,
#   in fact the whole GUS handler doesn't work properly, it totally fucks
#   up GUS memory
