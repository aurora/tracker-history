# ChibiTracker is a portable IT (Impulse Tracker) clone. It is not a 100%
# clone though, as it adds more features, such as chorus and reverb, stereo
# samples, an advanced sample editor and more. The user interface also
# presents some changes, as it can be custom themed and resized. ChibiTracker
# is Open Source Software under the GNU Public License, and it can be run
# under Windows, Mac-OS, Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS, and more to come.
