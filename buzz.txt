# [Wikipedia] Jeskola Buzz is a proprietary modular software music studio
# environment centered around a modular plugin-based machine view and a
# multiple pattern sequencer tracker (as opposed to a single pattern
# sequencer tracker). The long term future of the program is uncertain
# because the original sources have been lost. Nevertheless, it remains
# interesting historically since many applications have been derived from
# or inspired by the concepts, interfaces, and formats of Buzz, the "Buzz
# clones".

# Buzzwiki mentions a beta version in 1997-XX-XX, which strangely becomes
# before a15.

# [Wikipedia] The development of the core program, buzz.exe, was halted on
# October 5, 2000, when the developer lost the source code to the program.
# Nonetheless, since then many new and unique ideas have evolved using the
# existing plugin interface.
