# [WW] Ultimate Soundtracker 1.8
# * Binary contains "version 1.8 (pal )... release 04/1988." (Which also
#   scrolls across the screen.)
# * CIA/BPM Speed adjust appears. (The Ultimate Soundtracker .mod/song format
#   has always had a byte for this and different song do have different values
#   so I assume Karsten must have set it by hand or added it in one of the
#   non-released versions. For example "Telephone.mod" has a BPM of 112.
#   Other Trackers chose to remove or ignore it until its reintroduced.).

# "based on the original V1.21 version by Karsten Obarski"
#
# Modifications : Modulation.
# -------------   Enhanced portamento.
#                 Volume changing during play.
#                 Volume sliding up/down during play.
#                 Standard USA keymap.
#                 Playroutine for use in demos etc.
#                 Correct (?) spelling. (Karsten, it's spelled "Length" and
#                                        NOT "Lenght" !!)
#                                       (PHR....it ain't "Lengh", either !)
